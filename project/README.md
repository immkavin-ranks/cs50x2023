#### Video Demo:  [Youtube link](https://youtu.be/lfc8R3bAt8w)
#### Description:
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game project! This console-based game is a classic implementation of the number guessing concept, designed to entertain and challenge players with their deductive skills. Below is an in-depth overview of the project:

###

### Project Overview:
The Number Guessing Game is a C-based application that engages users in a guessing adventure. The game begins by generating a random secret number between 1 and 100. The player then attempts to guess this number within a maximum of 10 attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

###

### Key features:
* Random Number Generation: The game utilizes the rand() function seeded with the current time to ensure a dynamic and unpredictable secret number for each session.
* User Input Handling: Robust input validation ensures that the player enters valid guesses, preventing unexpected behavior and enhancing the overall user experience.
* Feedback Mechanism: Clear and concise feedback guides the player, helping them adjust their guesses and facilitating an enjoyable gameplay experience.


### Player Achievements:
The game recognizes player achievements, particularly when a new best score is achieved. If a player guesses the correct number in fewer attempts than their previous best, they receive a congratulatory message and an acknowledgment of their accomplishment.

###

### Files in the Project:
* **main.c:** Contains the main code for the number guessing game. It includes the game logic, random number generation, and user input handling.
* **README.md:** The documentation file you are currently reading, providing information about the project, its purpose, and how to use it.


### How to Play:
1. Run the compiled executable.
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the correct number.
1. Enter '0' to exit the game at any time.
1. The game keeps track of your best score.


### Future Enhancements:
The project can be further extended with additional features, such as graphical interfaces, difficulty levels, or even multiplayer capabilities. Contributions and ideas are always welcome!

###

### Project Structure:
* The project uses a straightforward loop structure for continuous gameplay.
* Thoughtful input validation ensures a smooth user experience without unexpected interruptions.
* The game sets a maximum attempt limit of 10, challenging players to make efficient and strategic guesses.


#### Note:
Ensure you have a C compiler installed to compile and run the program.
